	<p2>
	Born and raised in a small town in northwestern Illinois, I spent four years at Iowa State University learning graphic design and working in college football. During that time, I lived in Rome, Italy for four months. I moved to Chicago soon after graduation and have lived here ever since. I currently reside in Lincoln Park and work as a designer in the restaurant industry. <br>
	<b>Fun Facts:</b> I'm always thinking about my next trip or my next meal. I love red wine but will never turn down a Coors Light. My free time is spent at country concerts and sporting events.
